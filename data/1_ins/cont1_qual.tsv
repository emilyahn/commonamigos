Moved to USA when I was 13, studied and learned English at school. Along this time, my English improved, but, never leaving my Spanish. I'm very fluent in both languages now, and sometimes I do write and talk some Spanglish.

For it to feel more human-like, I would have to receive some sort of acknowledgment about the message that I sent rather than just question after question.

When they made a statement, I tried to ask more about the persons they mentioned and they would make a new statement
